# Costume Clash!

This is the repository for the Junior/Senior Collaborative Development module for Staffordshire University.

This project uses **Unreal Engine 5.2.1**, please make sure you have the appropriate version.

## Installation

Start off by creating a fork off of this repository, you can do this by pressing the [fork button](https://files.catbox.moe/rb1vjb.png) in the top right corner.

Once you've created a fork, click the green code button on **_your_** fork, then download it using your preferred git method, **_do not download the zip_** (_I will shame you if you do so_). Using github desktop can work, but is a nightmare most of the time.

You may need to add a "remote" to the main repository (https://github.com/Tea-Struction/CostumeClash.git) so that you can pull new edits to your code. I suggest googling how to do it using your current git client.

Now that you've downloaded it, open it up. [You may be prompted to rebuild your project](https://files.catbox.moe/6q76rj.png), **press yes**.

#### This is important, please [do this](https://files.catbox.moe/vxngzk.png).

^ Simply go to the tools tab, press "Generate Visual Studio Project".

You're now set! For help with github, please reach out if you have any issues, though I will likely be adding in a git contribution guide to this list later.
